			<h2>LDS Blog #6: BrainFactory 2025 - Expanding the Playground for Legal Design
			</h2>
			<div class="tags">
				<span class="tag">#BrainFactory</span>
			</div>

			<br>
			<p>
				For years, the BrainFactory concept has been one of the most loved parts of the Legal Design Summit: an
				immersive three-day experience where a small group of around 40–45 participants worked side-by-side with
				top facilitators from around the world to tackle real-life legal challenges
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Over the years, we’ve heard more than once: “BrainFactory changed my life.” That kind of feedback is
				both humbling and energising — a reminder of the power of bringing people together in a space that
				sparks creativity, courage, and collaboration.
			</p>
			<p>
				This year we asked: how might we make BrainFactory accessible to more people without diminishing
				opportunities for individual connection, creativity, and shared learning? What resulted is a bold leap:
				tripling the number of attendees by welcoming 125 participants into the experience across 9 workshops.
			</p>
			<p>By expanding the number and variety of workshops, our goal is to significantly increase the number of
				people who get to experience and lead BrainFactory. More participants mean more perspectives, more
				diversity, and more accessibility. We believe that’s where the magic happens.</p>


			<h3>From a small lab to a city-wide experience</h3>
			<p>
				Instead of three days in one location, BrainFactory will unfold in a single, dynamic day across
				Helsinki. Nine workshops, each led by a unique team of facilitators, will dive into different corners of
				legal design. From AI to sustainability to access to justice, participants can explore specialized
				themes or start from the basics if they’re just beginning their journey.
			</p>
			<p>
				This shift isn’t just about efficiency, although it helps participants who might only be able to take
				one more day off work. It’s about creating more intersections: more voices, more experiences, more
				chances for people to meet collaborators they’d never otherwise cross paths.
			</p>


			<h3>Co-creation at its core</h3>
			<p>
				While the BrainFactory spirit has always been co-creative, we wanted to extend that opportunity to the
				facilitators themselves. Some workshop teams are made up of long-time friends and past collaborators,
				already attuned to each other’s ways of thinking. Others are brand-new combinations, meeting for the
				first time through this process. In both cases, the result is a vibrant space where people who share a
				deep passion for legal design — and have been working on it professionally for years — come together to
				create something unique. Along the way, they’re learning from each other, exchanging methods, and
				inspiring one another in real time.

			</p>
			<p>
				We sought out facilitators who could bring substance from different areas of legal design, from
				different areas of the world, ensuring the program reflects the diversity and depth of the field today.
				It all comes together thanks to sponsors who make the workshops possible and bring their own expertise
				to the table. We are incredible grateful to our sponsors in this process.
			</p>

			<h3>Always learning and evolving</h3>
			<p>
				As always, BrainFactory is a work in progress. We welcome feedback from every participant, so that in
				the future, it can grow in directions we can’t even imagine yet.

				We asked Outi Nokkonen to share her Legal Design story, and uncovered fascinating insights about
				bringing creativity to traditionally rigid systems! In this ongoing series featuring Legal Design Summit
				2025 Speaker Testimonials, we're thrilled to spotlight professionals who are reshaping how we think
				about law, design, and human experience.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Meet Outi Nokkonen, who is a Finnish service designer with over 12 years transforming public sector
				services through design thinking. Her mission is making public procurement more accessible, human, and
				less intimidating. With her background in social sciences and political science, she brings a unique
				societal lens to design work. Currently deepening her expertise by studying procurement and law, she's
				proving that regulation can enable innovation rather than block it. Her upcoming LDS presentation with
				Peegi Kaibald explores how design shifts not just processes, but the entire mindset of public officials.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through three key questions, we explored our Legal Design Summit 2025 speakers' journeys, and their
				responses are truly inspiring! You'll find Outi's thoughts below.
			</p>


			<h3>Tell us your legal design story - what brought you here?</h3>
			<p>
				For me, legal design is a promising and much needed approach to making the public sector and especially
				public procurement more accessible, human and less intimidating.

				I’ve spent the past 12 years working both inside and alongside the Finnish public sector, and throughout
				that time, my mission has been to make design thinking a natural part of developing public services and
				systems. In recent years, I’ve become increasingly focused on public procurement. It’s a space that’s
				often seen as too technical or too regulated for creativity, which is exactly why it needs legal design.
				There’s enormous potential to reimagine procurement as a tool for collaboration, clarity and meaningful
				impact.

			</p>

			<h3>What are you most looking forward to about the LDS?</h3>
			<p>
				I’m looking forward to discovering new ideas and perspectives. I hope to get inspired by what legal
				design could enable in the context of public procurement — and what new possibilities we might uncover.

			</p>

			<h3>What key message do you hope to convey? (a teaser on your presentation)</h3>
			<p>
				In collaboration with Peegi Kaibald and drawing from Estonia’s pioneering work in legal design, we will
				explore how even the most regulated parts of public administration (like public procurement) can be
				reimagined through design. Our aim is to show how design can shift not just processes and documents, but
				the mindset of public officials.

				earned the prestigious Estonian Design Award in 2024! With master's degrees in service innovation
				and
				design, she's proving that design can make law accessible. Her upcoming LDS presentation with Outi
				Nokkonen will explore how design evolves from buzzword to genuine mindset for public officials.
				Through three key questions, we explored our Legal Design Summit 2025 speakers' journeys, and their
				responses are truly inspiring! You'll find Peegi's thoughts below.

			</p>


			<h3>Tell us your legal design story - what brought you here?</h3>
			<p>
				What I love about legal design is its power to help people navigate complex legal systems without
				feeling lost, excluded, small, or inadequate. For me, it’s all about making the legal system more
				human
				– so people can feel seen, cared for, and able to move through it without feeling helpless.

			</p>
			<p>
				I’m glad I can give my own contribution to that as a service designer-business analyst in the
				Estonian
				public sector, where I lead legal projects focused on grant measure design, information design,
				process
				improvement, and digital transformation. My journey into legal design began over five years ago when
				I
				joined the newly established service design unit at the Estonian State Shared Service Centre – the
				institution responsible for managing the European Union funds in Estonia. At the time, we were just
				beginning to explore how design could bring meaningful impact to the complex and highly regulated
				world
				of grants. From then on, my interest in legal design deepened through my master’s thesis in Service
				Innovation and Design at Laurea University of Applied Sciences, where I explored the process of
				shaping
				our team’s mission and value proposition – an effort that opened up new ways for us to approach
				legal
				design in practice.
			</p>
			<p>

				Working hands-on with grant regulations and public sector challenges have shown me how legal design
				can
				not only break down silos but genuinely make law more accessible – in both content and clarity. I’m
				proud that our legal design initiatives have also gained recognition and I hope that the Estonian
				Design
				Award my colleagues and I received in 2024 for our transformative legal design work inspires others
				to
				believe in and to adopt legal design practices as well.

			</p>
			<h3>What are you most looking forward to about the LDS?</h3>
			<p>
				I’m really excited to be part of the legal design community and to get inspired and to connect with
				peers from other organizations, countries, and continents who are tackling similar challenges. What
				I
				especially appreciate about the Summit is its interdisciplinary spirit as it brings together
				lawyers,
				designers, and other changemakers. I believe it is exactly this mix of perspectives and expertise
				that
				drives legal design forward.

			</p>

			<h3>What key message do you hope to convey? (a teaser on your presentation)</h3>
			<p>
				I’m delighted to join forces with Outi Nokkonen to explore how design can evolve from a buzzword
				into a
				genuine mindset and daily practice for public officials. Together, we’ll share experiences from
				Estonia
				and Finland to find out whether this challenge is a mission impossible or a breakthrough waiting to
				happen.

				of discovery and purpose! In this ongoing series featuring Legal Design Summit 2025 Speaker
				Testimonials, we're thrilled to spotlight professionals who are reshaping how we think about law,

				Meet Natalia Grant, who is a Senior UX Researcher at Jaramillo Villamizar and an innovator who's
				spent
				over 20 years making complex experiences beautifully simple. Her journey from journalism to UX

				Through three key questions, we explored our Legal Design Summit 2025 speakers' journeys, and their
				responses are truly inspiring! You’ll find Natalia’s thoughts below.

			</p>


			<h3>Tell us your legal design story - what brought you here?</h3>
			<p>
				“Last year, after two decades in UX, I was searching for deeper meaning in my career when I was
				contacted by Jaramillo Villamizar, a legal firm that was expanding its Legal Design practice. Thanks
				to
				them, I realized that as a UX Researcher, I was already involved in this field by observing people
				interacting with legal systems in multiple cultures, and that my role was sort of promoting change
				and
				justice for them. Finding Legal Design was reconnecting with my career roots: journalism and
				information
				architecture.”
			</p>
			<h3>What are you most looking forward to about the LDS?</h3>
			<p>
				“I’m passionate about communities, and I look forward to connecting with people and their stories,
				and
				secondly, to learning more about what is happening in the Legal Design World and how to add value as
				a
				professional and as a company. As a researcher, I’m curious about how lawyers work across different
				cultures and what similarities or differences there are compared to the USA and Latin America, so I
				will
				be observing and listening.”

			</p>

			<h3>What key message do you hope to convey? (a teaser on your presentation)</h3>
			<p>
				“In my talk, I expect to create awareness about the importance of understanding the user's context
				for
				designing better Legal Experiences. I’ll provide tips and tricks to run observational research,
				based on
				two cases: the closing ceremony of buying a house in Massachusetts and the reading analysis from a
				package insert of a pharmaceutical ecosystem. I think the best way to unlock clarity is by observing
				what could be “blurring” the user's understanding beyond the text or technology itself.”

			<h3>How we built the program </h3>
			<p>
				First, thank you to the brilliant team: Akvilė, Danielle, Katie, Marielle, Mia, Sade and Serena. For
				their collective effort over the last six months. It was a pleasure to work with a group of
				committed volunteers who, each in their own way, brought energy, creativity and curiosity to the
				process. Say hello and a big thank you when you see them in Helsinki!
				Building on the momentum of a remarkable 2023 Summit, we set out to do something bold for the fifth
				LDS: create an ambitious, advanced and future-looking program. To get there, we collaborated across
				the LDS team, embedded design thinking into our methods, and co-created with our community.
				Step-by-step, here’s how we built the program:
			</p>
			<h3>1. Brainstorming workshop</h3>
			<p>
				We kicked things off with a workshop with the LDS team to explore what our audiences needed and
				brainstorm possible themes. We mapped the legal design landscape through three lenses - the past,
				present, and future - and explored how those themes met the needs of different audiences, for
				example academics, practitioners, and participants new to the scene. One interesting thing we
				highlighted was the opportunity to create a stronger feedback loop between academic research and how
				legal design is being applied in practice.
				In addition to being good fun and a bit of an icebreaker for a new team, the workshop also gave us
				clear direction for the types of proposals we wanted to attract, highlighting themes from AI
				governance to access to justice to re-designing democracies. The workshop also identified
				opportunities for new content - this blog being one of them!

			</p>


			<h3>2. Call for speakers </h3>
			<p>
				We launched a public call for speaking proposals at the end of April 2025. This was open for one
				month and required submission of a Google form. The form included a series of questions, from
				motivations for speaking to a short summary of the proposal itself.
				We received over 70 proposals! The overall quality of the proposal was extremely high and we were
				impressed with the depth and breadth of the ideas and concepts. Thanks again to everyone who took
				the time to submit a proposal.
			</p>


			<h3>3. Reviewing proposals </h3>
			<p>
				To ensure fairness and quality, we designed a collaborative and robust review process. Every
				proposal was reviewed independently by at least two team members, using pre-agreed criteria and a
				shared scoring framework.
				We prioritised proposals that aligned with themes identified in the workshop and presented new,
				interesting, and original ideas. We welcomed proposals that were critical of legal design, as we
				highlighted this as an important intervention for the movement to continue building momentum. We
				dismissed proposals of a commercial nature.
				With 22 sessions to fill, we created an exhaustive shortlist of the top performing proposals. It
				took several brainstorming sessions to discuss the ideas and boil the number of proposals down.
				Making final decisions was definitely the hardest part of the process. In some cases, we noticed
				several strong proposals orbiting the same theme, so decided to combine their ideas into joint
				sessions.
			</p>


			<h3>4. Designing the program and confirming speakers </h3>
			<p>
				Once we had our shortlist, we started shaping the full program. We clustered the final set of
				proposals to find subtle narratives and identify themes that complemented each other. This was
				critical as we wanted to get the pacing and flow just right - making sure attendees would have a
				meaningful and engaging arc across the two days. Equally, we ensured a healthy balance between
				keynote speeches (20 mins) and fireside chats (30 mins), as well as coffee and lunch breaks.
				We confirmed the final speaker list at the end of May. Where we grouped proposals together, we
				scheduled calls to facilitate introductions, explain our rationale for creating joint sessions, and
				discuss their session. One team member commented that:
				<em> “Creating fireside chats was one of our favorite parts of the process and we loved seeing
					speakers embrace the LDS spirit. One highlight was a panel meeting for the first time and
					immediately using a Miro board to find the common threads between their proposals and working
					collaboratively to brainstorm their session.”</em>
			</p>
			<h2>What we created</h2>
			<p>We think we’ve created an exciting, innovative and diverse program. There are some familiar faces
				and, of course, returning legends. However, the majority of the program includes new people and
				perspectives ready to challenge and expand what legal design is and can be. Here’s the unfiltered
				breakdown across the two days: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Day 1 is pure legal design, with a focus on its role and value across the profession. We’ll look
					at
					how legal design is shaping policy making, transforming legal services and grappling with
					generative
					AI - the sector’s biggest disruptor.</li>
				<li>Day 2 is about impact, and what legal design can do for people and the planet. The future of law
					is
					as much about social and nature value as it is about technology innovation, so sessions touch on
					big
					systemic issues, including sustainability, justice and education.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>We also created something new: The LDS Gallery </h2>
			<p>We received so many incredible proposals this year, but unfortunately couldn’t fit everyone on the
				shortlist into the program. So we’re launching a new platform. A new space to showcase the important
				and inspirational work that the legal design community is shaping around the world.

				The gallery will be a digital exhibition, initially launched with a select group of contributors,
				with the aim of exhibiting legal design projects, experiences and case studies. The response so far
				has been very positive. When confirmed, one contributor said:

				“I’m excited by this new feature and truly appreciate the opportunity to showcase my work in this
				innovative format.”

				Our ambition is that the Gallery becomes the Louvre of Legal Design, and look forward to sharing the
				first iteration with you soon.
			</p>
			<h2>Final reflections - what we learned</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>This was less about building an event schedule and more about writing the next chapter in the
					legal
					design story </li>
				<li>The quality, ambition and range of perspectives across the ecosystem is genuinely incredible and
					inspiring </li>
				<li>Embedding design thinking into our approach was our most valuable tool </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thanks again to everyone involved - see you in Helsinki in September! </p>

			<h2>LDS Blog #1: The Legal Design Summit: What we stand for as a global movement</h2>
			<footer class="author">
				<img src="images/team/team-2025/sade_mantyla_vice_chair.jpeg" alt="Portrait of Sade Mäntylä" />

					political scientist, doctoral researcher, and Vice Chair at the
					Legal Design Summit.
				</p>
			</footer>
			<br>
			<div class="tags">
				<span class="tag">#Selflessness</span>
				<span class="tag">#Inclusion</span>
				<span class="tag">#Courage</span>
				<span class="tag">#Authenticity</span>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>The Legal Design Summit</strong> began as a movement focused on
				the end-users of legal services. Thus, the initial focus of the
				event, founded in 2016, was on contract design, user-experience in
				various legal services, and the wider interlinks between technology
				and law.
			</p>
			<p>
				While legal design is still about all of these things, over the years,
				the Summit and the associated movement and community have grown
				towards a more ambitious agenda. The aim is no longer simply making
				law more usable but <em>redesigning the whole legal system</em>. What
				started off as a user-centric revolution in law is today a globally
				significant non-governmental organization aiming for transborder
				solidarity, deliberative democracy, social innovation and practical
				justice outcomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				To reflect this changing vision ahead of the 2025 event, it was time
				to clarify what the Summit stands for. As a community, the Legal
				Design Summit is committed to four core values:
				<strong>selflessness, inclusion, courage, and authenticity</strong>. In
				what follows, I will explain how each is reflected in our activities.
			</p>


			<h3>Selflessness</h3>
			<p>
				Selflessness means that we believe in collective action and support as
				the most important tools in achieving our shared goals. We see each
				other and the world with empathy and never put personal gain before
				the interests of the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Summit, organized by volunteers and relying on self-funded
				speakers, is not about personal profit or monetary value, but about a
				value of a different kind: collective imagination for better futures.
				This is no longer limited to simply end-users or other human beings
				but encompasses non-human beings, the environment, and even the future
				of life on earth.
			</p>

			<h3>Inclusion</h3>
			<p>
				By being inclusive we strive to create a space where different
				perspectives and backgrounds come together, and where diversity is
				celebrated – both in organizers and speakers. While legal design is
				still dominated by lawyers from Western countries, both legal and
				non-legal professionals from all over the world are increasingly and
				importantly involved in the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				By organizing the Summit free of charge and with a focus on globally
				relevant themes, we aim to foster an accessible, international and
				multicultural community where anyone can participate in shaping the
				future of law.
			</p>

			<h3>Courage</h3>
			<p>
				Courage means that reaching for the impossible is in our backbone. We
				are curious about the world and passionate about improving it by
				innovatively combining practical and academic knowledge. When faced
				with a problem to solve, we ask: <em>how hard can it be?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that we do not steer away from wicked problems – be they
				functional or theoretical. Nor do we accept the status quo as it is.
				There is always room for improvement, and it is up to brave people to
				rise to the challenge.
			</p>

			<h3>Authenticity</h3>
			<p>
				Authenticity means that the Summit is dedicated to making a difference
				through creative, outside-the-box design thinking. We strive to make
				an impact by showing up as our authentic selves and by remaining
				honest and open about our core mission.
			</p>
			<p>
				By welcoming anyone from any background into the community, we aim to
				expand possibilities for legal design across all areas of law and
				society. This means remaining open towards what legal design can be,
				as well as its limitations – while staying true to the common core of
				design-thinking.
			</p>

			<h3>The value of collective imagination in turbulent times</h3>
			<p>
				As our guiding values show, the Summit stands for an important
				message. The Summit is not about monetary value, even if it often
				translates into it – many fantastic careers have taken off in its
				wake. Instead, it is about scaling ideas for a better world. When a
				diverse group of open-minded people with different perspectives come
				together, the outcome is bound to be valuable. Yet the value of such
				an outcome cannot be expressed in monetary terms, as its primary aim
				is not to create profit. Instead, it creates a path for a world where
				well-being and social justice are a reality for more ‘users’ – both
				human and non-human.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my personal key learnings from being involved in the Summit for
				the past few years is that a group of dedicated and imaginative people
				working for the same end goal can achieve – if not anything, almost
				anything. As we look to the upcoming event and beyond, the Summit
				invites everyone to join this community towards a world that is more
				just <em>by design</em>.
