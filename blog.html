			<h2>The Legal Design Summit: What we stand for as a global movement</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>The Legal Design Summit</strong> began as a movement focused on
				the end-users of legal services. Thus, the initial focus of the
				event, founded in 2016, was on contract design, user-experience in
				various legal services, and the wider interlinks between technology
				and law.
			</p>
			<p>
				While legal design is still about all of these things, over the years,
				the Summit and the associated movement and community have grown
				towards a more ambitious agenda. The aim is no longer simply making
				law more usable but <em>redesigning the whole legal system</em>. What
				started off as a user-centric revolution in law is today a globally
				significant non-governmental organization aiming for transborder
				solidarity, deliberative democracy, social innovation and practical
				justice outcomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				To reflect this changing vision ahead of the 2025 event, it was time
				to clarify what the Summit stands for. As a community, the Legal
				Design Summit is committed to four core values:
				<strong>selflessness, inclusion, courage, and authenticity</strong>. In
				what follows, I will explain how each is reflected in our activities.
			</p>

			<!--  Core values -->
			<h3>Selflessness</h3>
			<p>
				Selflessness means that we believe in collective action and support as
				the most important tools in achieving our shared goals. We see each
				other and the world with empathy and never put personal gain before
				the interests of the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Summit, organized by volunteers and relying on self-funded
				speakers, is not about personal profit or monetary value, but about a
				value of a different kind: collective imagination for better futures.
				This is no longer limited to simply end-users or other human beings
				but encompasses non-human beings, the environment, and even the future
				of life on earth.
			</p>

			<h3>Inclusion</h3>
			<p>
				By being inclusive we strive to create a space where different
				perspectives and backgrounds come together, and where diversity is
				celebrated – both in organizers and speakers. While legal design is
				still dominated by lawyers from Western countries, both legal and
				non-legal professionals from all over the world are increasingly and
				importantly involved in the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				By organizing the Summit free of charge and with a focus on globally
				relevant themes, we aim to foster an accessible, international and
				multicultural community where anyone can participate in shaping the
				future of law.
			</p>

			<h3>Courage</h3>
			<p>
				Courage means that reaching for the impossible is in our backbone. We
				are curious about the world and passionate about improving it by
				innovatively combining practical and academic knowledge. When faced
				with a problem to solve, we ask: <em>how hard can it be?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that we do not steer away from wicked problems – be they
				functional or theoretical. Nor do we accept the status quo as it is.
				There is always room for improvement, and it is up to brave people to
				rise to the challenge.
			</p>

			<h3>Authenticity</h3>
			<p>
				Authenticity means that the Summit is dedicated to making a difference
				through creative, outside-the-box design thinking. We strive to make
				an impact by showing up as our authentic selves and by remaining
				honest and open about our core mission.
			</p>
			<p>
				By welcoming anyone from any background into the community, we aim to
				expand possibilities for legal design across all areas of law and
				society. This means remaining open towards what legal design can be,
				as well as its limitations – while staying true to the common core of
				design-thinking.
			</p>

			<h3>The value of collective imagination in turbulent times</h3>
			<p>
				As our guiding values show, the Summit stands for an important
				message. The Summit is not about monetary value, even if it often
				translates into it – many fantastic careers have taken off in its
				wake. Instead, it is about scaling ideas for a better world. When a
				diverse group of open-minded people with different perspectives come
				together, the outcome is bound to be valuable. Yet the value of such
				an outcome cannot be expressed in monetary terms, as its primary aim
				is not to create profit. Instead, it creates a path for a world where
				well-being and social justice are a reality for more ‘users’ – both
				human and non-human.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my personal key learnings from being involved in the Summit for
				the past few years is that a group of dedicated and imaginative people
				working for the same end goal can achieve – if not anything, almost
				anything. As we look to the upcoming event and beyond, the Summit
				invites everyone to join this community towards a world that is more
				just <em>by design</em>.
