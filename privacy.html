	  <p>You can influence the type of data we collect. However, participation in our events requires that you submit your personal data. If you decide not to submit your personal data to us, we may be unable to provide all the possibilities of our events to you.</p>

	  <h4>3.	What is the data used for?</h4>
	  <p>We process your data in order to organize our events. We also process your data if it is necessary for the realization our legitimate interest.</p>
	  <p>“Legitimate interest” refers to our actions that are allowed by law and which are in direct relation to our operations. We may act on the grounds of legitimate interest where a significant and pertinent relationship exists between the participant and us. This means that the relationship has been formed for the purpose of participating in our events itself or in the organization of the event in the role of e.g. audience, a member of organizers or a member of partnering organizations.</p>
	  <p>In assessing legitimate interest, both the interests of the participant and ours are evaluated, taking in to account the realization of fundamental rights, the nature and purpose of use of the data collected, and data security. This process has been explained e.g. by the European Data Authorities and we follow these established guidelines.</p>
	  <p>The participant has the right to object to processing that occurs on the basis of a legitimate interest.  We explain this further in the section 8. In some cases, we may ask your consent for processing your data for example by using opt-in check boxes in registration or other forms.</p>
	  <p>We also process your data to better be able to market our event. We may also process your data when conducting marketing surveys and opinion polls to gain a better understanding of our participants and thereby make the event better. We target our content to provide you with information about our event that is as relevant as possible. The targeting of our content is based on interests and information we have collected. For example, we might send different information to investors than startup entrepreneurs.</p>
	  <p>We process the data for analysis, for compiling statistics and reporting, again, mainly to develop our event and to improve the participant experience.</p>
