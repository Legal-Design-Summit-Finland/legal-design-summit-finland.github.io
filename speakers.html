With over 15 years of experience in legal higher education, she strongly advocates for integrating design thinking and visual communication into law curricula. She sees design as a critical lens—one that helps future legal professionals assess, question, and shape how technology is adopted. She believes meaningful legal innovation requires interdisciplinary collaboration within multidisciplinary teams. Her current research explores how legal professionals in the Netherlands understand and apply AI in their daily practice.",
