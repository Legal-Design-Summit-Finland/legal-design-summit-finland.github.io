                                    <h4>About this work</h4>
                                    <p>Legal documents are notoriously difficult to understand due to their complexity,
                                        formal language, and abstract terminology. This creates a communication barrier
                                        between legal professionals and their clients, particularly non-lawyers who are
                                        often the intended recipients of these documents. Our work addresses this issue
                                        through the development of a visual tool: the Legal Icon Dictionary.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Legal Icon Dictionary is a curated set of intuitive, standardized icons that
                                        represent key legal terms and concepts. It functions as a visual layer that can
                                        be integrated into legal documents - such as contracts, terms and conditions,
                                        and privacy policies - to support and clarify written content. The dictionary
                                        transforms abstract or ambiguous legal ideas into concrete, visual symbols that
                                        enhance comprehension and reduce cognitive load.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In co-creation of legal designers, graphic designers, and users, we mapped
                                        common legal concepts that are difficult to interpret and translated them into
                                        universally understandable icons. The process involved user research, iterative
                                        prototyping, and validation to ensure each icon conveyed its intended meaning.
                                        What inspired this project was a very practical challenge: even when lawyers
                                        want to make their documents more accessible by using visual elements, they
                                        often struggle to find the right tools. Searching through hundreds of icons
                                        online or trying to assemble visuals in office software can be frustrating and
                                        time-consuming. Our goal was not only to make documents easier to understand for
                                        end users, but also to make them easier to create for legal professionals.
                                        In its current format, the Legal Icon Dictionary consists of the:

                                    </ul>

                                    – free for everyone to download and implement into their work. It reflects our
                                    commitment to demystifying the law through design, accessibility, and empathy.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>The Legal Icon Dictionary has had an impact on both legal professionals and
                                        document recipients. By providing a ready-to-use, thoughtfully designed set of
                                        icons, we enabled lawyers - especially those taking their first steps into legal
                                        design—to create clearer, more user-friendly documents without the typical
                                        frustration of searching for visuals or struggling with formatting.
                                        We know of instances where the icons have been implemented into real-life legal
                                        documents, such as terms of service, privacy policies, and contracts. The icons
                                        helped clarify the structure and meaning of the text, resulting in more
                                        accessible and transparent communication for end users.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Beyond document design, the Icon Dictionary has become a valuable resource in
                                        our legal design workshops. We use it as both a practical tool and an
                                        educational example of how visual thinking can improve legal communication. It
                                        allows participants to experience first-hand how even small design interventions
                                        - like the addition of icons - can have a significant (good or bad, depending on
                                        the use!) effect on the document created.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By addressing the needs of both document creators and users, the Icon Dictionary
                                        continues to promote a more human-centered approach to law, lowering barriers to
                                        understanding and empowering legal professionals to innovate.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Key learnings</h4>
                                    <p>One of our key learnings was that visual tools can significantly enhance the
                                        accessibility of legal information - but only when used in the right context.
                                        While icons have the potential to clarify complex content, we discovered that
                                        without supporting context, users often interpreted them in unintended ways.
                                        This underlined the abstract nature of symbols: an icon on its own is rarely
                                        self-explanatory. Providing a clear use-case or embedding the icon within a
                                        familiar legal structure improved user understanding and reduced
                                        misinterpretation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We also learned that even minor visual details - like the presence or absence of
                                        a magnifying glass - can dramatically alter how icons are perceived. Users
                                        tended to over-focus on specific graphic elements, leading to unexpected
                                        associations. As a result, icon design must be tested with real users and
                                        refined, as small changes can have a huge impact on usability.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A positive takeaway was that icons resembling familiar visual systems (e.g.,
                                        from Office or mobile apps) were more easily understood. Leveraging users'
                                        existing visual literacy helped ground abstract legal concepts in something
                                        intuitive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        At OliveHarbor Global Solutions (OGS), we are developing Law & Tea—a
                                        community-based legal conversation series that brings everyday justice
                                        discussions into warm, welcoming spaces.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>


                                        Many people—especially youth, women, informal workers, and migrants—don’t access
                                        legal support because traditional spaces feel intimidating or inaccessible. To
                                        respond, Law & Tea offers a low-cost, dialogue-based alternative, hosted
                                        in-person at local centres and cafés, and virtually via small Zoom circles.
                                        Each session features:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A real-life legal scenario or story</li>
                                        <li>A visual “cheat sheet” or guide to simplify legal concepts</li>
                                        <li>A trained facilitator to guide the discussion</li>
                                        <li>A relaxed space where tea is shared and questions are welcomed</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Topics range from housing disputes and job contracts to school rights and
                                        reporting abuse. The approach blends legal education, storytelling, and
                                        community care—without jargon or fear. The sessions are co-created with local
                                        youth groups and grassroots organisations in Kenya and Italy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By designing Law & Tea for both physical and virtual access, we’re making space
                                        for justice conversations that meet people where they are—emotionally,
                                        geographically, and socially.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Still in the early pilot phase, we’ve hosted initial Law & Tea sessions in
                                        Nairobi (in-person) and Vicenza (virtually), reaching young people, community
                                        educators, and migrant leaders.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The relaxed and inclusive format has helped participants open up, ask questions,
                                        and begin to connect legal knowledge with their lived experiences. Several
                                        organisations have requested toolkits to host their own sessions, and we’re
                                        working on expanding this model based on the feedback received.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Key learnings</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        We learned that building trust is foundational to legal learning. Hosting
                                        conversations over tea—whether around a physical table or a virtual
                                        screen—encourages openness and reduces fear.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We also learned that low-tech tools like story cards, visual handouts, and
                                        real-life scenarios are highly effective across languages and educational
                                        levels. The model can be adapted for civic education, environmental rights,
                                        mental health awareness, or gender justice.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Other organisations can easily replicate Law & Tea by using a facilitation
                                        guide, visual materials, and trusted local hosts.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Meet me at the conference</h4>
                                    <p>We’re excited to discuss how low-cost, low-barrier legal design can support
                                        meaningful access to justice. Law & Tea shows that with community care, cultural
                                        humility, and creativity, we can turn ordinary moments into opportunities for
                                        empowerment.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        We also look forward to learning how others are facilitating hybrid legal
                                        learning spaces, and how design can better support inclusion in both digital and
                                        offline formats.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In 2023–24, a legal design project with CatholicCare’s Refugee Hub followed a
                                        five-step participatory design process, widely recognized in legal design
                                        practice. But as the project unfolded, we discovered something important: the
                                        standard approach doesn’t fully account for the realities of working with
                                        culturally and linguistically diverse communities.

                                    <h4>Key insights from the project:</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Time and patience matter. The design process often takes longer than
                                        expected—especially when building trust and understanding across cultures.
                                        Typical funding cycles may not allow for the flexibility needed.
                                        Culture shapes design. Cultural norms and communication styles influence how
                                        people engage with legal resources. These factors must be thoughtfully
                                        integrated into every stage of the process.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Service providers are essential partners. Rather than being peripheral, service
                                        providers should be central collaborators. Their insights and relationships with
                                        the community are vital for creating resources that truly work.
                                        Sustainability is a design step. To ensure long-term impact, the final step in
                                        the design process should focus on sustaining relationships and engagement. This
                                        means building strategies for ongoing collaboration and resource use beyond the
                                        project’s end.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By placing these considerations at the heart of legal design theory and
                                        practice—and adding “sustaining” as a formal step—we can create tools that
                                        better serve diverse communities and contribute meaningfully to a more
                                        accessible justice system.
                                        Our work has created specific resources but also further developed the legal
                                        design process.

                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Over 18 months we co-designed two printed resources to support the community's
                                        understanding of the Special Humanitarian Visa Process and Australia's driving
                                        laws. These were two areas where low legal literacy significantly impacting on
                                        people’s lives. For the visa, it meant people could not make informed decisions
                                        regarding the likelihood of success (less than 10%), or the waiting time (often
                                        decades). For the driving guide, it meant people were going to court to contest
                                        charges which led to a criminal conviction. Criminal convictions can mean they
                                        cannot become citizens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        We have hosted workshops in three different languages to determine if the visa
                                        resource improved legal literacy - and it did! People had a better understanding
                                        of the visa options available to them and the steps to apply for the visa. The
                                        resource has been translated into five key languages.

                                        The traffic guide is used by four different organizations. This guide has been
                                        particularly useful for service providers who are not familiar with the laws,
                                        but provide legal guidance to clients.

                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Key learnings</h4>
                                    <p>The legal design process itself can increase the capacity of communities. It
                                        provides a forum for them to speak into the issues that impact on them, ask
                                        questions, and through co-creation, increase their ability to explain the issues
                                        to other people.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Good design takes time, especially when working with culturally and
                                        linguistically diverse communities. It is important to take the time to build a
                                        team who represents a variety of experiences and expertise. It takes time to
                                        build trust, to ensure people can speak into the process as equals. Respecting
                                        cultural norms, like Ramadan, mourning periods, or the need to travel
                                        internationally for extended periods, can also mean that the project will take
                                        more time. Time needs to be invested at the end as well, to ensure it continues
                                        to reflect the needs of the community.

                                    <p>
                                        During the translation process, we also learned that AI can be a powerful tool
                                        for simplifying complex language. However, it must also be used cautiously as it
                                        can change the meaning of the language.
                                    </p>

                                        I would love to connect with other people doing co-design to support communities
                                        from migration backgrounds.

                                        The next step of our design project is to transform parts of our written
                                        resources into reel-style videos. Particularly for the guide to driving in
                                        Australia, our younger audience does not find the printed resources (or virtual
                                        version) engaging. This is an exciting new challenge - how to translate key
                                        information into an accessible format that will appeal to younger people.

                                            The first work is an illustration that combines legal and technical aspects
                                            relating to AI. The illustration aims to gap knowledge from two very
                                            different areas, legal and technical, in order to understand the

                                            The second work is a business model innovation map that collects 27
                                            open-source software (OS) business models, 5 business model categories from
                                            open data (OD) and 4 from open hardware (OH) into a holistic map. The map is
                                            meant to navigate through the multifaceted business model landscape of open
                                            assets.

                                            data ecosystems and the promotion of data sharing to advance smart city
                                            initiatives. Our objective was to collect guidelines, share valuable

                                        All artefacts aim to give a diverse group of users easy access to complex
                                        knowledge that contains multidisciplinary elements, for instance legal, business
                                        and research aspects.

                                        more structured manner – for instance, what kind of legal challenges arise with
                                        respect to different components involved or what kind of ethical questions may
                                        arise in different phases of the machine learning process.

                                        A company can use the map to navigate through the multifaceted business model
                                        landscape of open assets. A company can explore the map to investigate the
                                        opportunities embedded in these business models and use it as a base for the
                                        innovation of its own business model.

                                    <h4>Key learnings</h4>
                                    <p>For me, one of the key learnings from the above work has been in understanding
                                        how design work intertwines with substance work, be it legal, business or other.
                                        Designers do not work merely to produce a final artefact, like the maps or
                                        guidebooks presented above. Visual thinking and design should be used also for
                                        the intermediate steps to enhance the substance thinking. This phase of the work
                                        is closely connected to substance knowledge and requires multidisciplinary
                                        capabilities, often several participants.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In legal design, this emphasises the need for constant, iterative discussions
                                        between legal experts and design experts. And, as legal design is there to
                                        resolve a problem for different types of users from several expert disciplines
                                        or technological fields, this iterative process requires interaction with
                                        several other fields.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This kind of multidisciplinary design process calls for different design methods
                                        and tools for different phases. One might use systemic design tools to
                                        understand the problem, for instance how business and legal issues interact,
                                        then turn into service design methods to increase understanding on the user and
                                        finally to produce an artefact that helps the user in resolving the problem at
                                        hand.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        HiiL’s Justice Innovation Lab (JIL) addresses one of the world’s most urgent
                                        challenges: the justice gap. We know that justice problems, whether related to
                                        land, family, crime, or neighbour disputes, are common and have a serious impact
                                        on people’s lives. Yet, more than two-thirds of the world’s population still
                                        fail to find resolution. It’s clear that justice systems are not meeting
                                        people’s everyday needs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This is where people-centred justice comes in. It’s an emerging approach that
                                        transforms justice systems by putting people and their justice needs at the
                                        centre, rather than institutional interests.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An integral tool for advancing this approach is the Justice Innovation Lab—a
                                        structured, design-thinking process that brings together a diverse group of
                                        stakeholders, including government leaders, judges, lawyers, community
                                        organisers, entrepreneurs, and users of justice. The process starts with data.
                                        Using insights from HiiL’s Justice Needs and Satisfaction (JNS) surveys and
                                        other research, the participants identify the most frequent and impactful
                                        justice problems people face. They then map user journeys to understand the
                                        barriers they encounter and use these insights to guide the co-creation of
                                        practical, locally grounded solutions. Over four to six months, co-create
                                        solutions, test ideas, prototype, build governance structures and sustainable
                                        financial models, and design pilot programmes ready for implementation.
                                        What makes the JIL unique is its deep commitment to local ownership, relevance
                                        and sustainability. In addition to formal justice actors, the Lab includes
                                        informal providers and people who have experienced justice problems firsthand.
                                        This broad participation ensures that both the design process and the solutions
                                        are not only innovative but truly people-centred.

                                        Inspired by innovation labs in health, education, and finance, the JIL adapts
                                        this method specifically for the justice sector: one of the most under-innovated
                                        public services. It provides the structure, tools, and collaborative space
                                        needed to create justice services that are scalable, sustainable, and genuinely
                                        solve people’s justice problems.

                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        One example of impact from our work was in Ethiopia, where over 7 million legal
                                        issues arise annually—most remaining unresolved. Many people rely on shimagillé,
                                        respected community elders, to mediate disputes. However, both this traditional
                                        system and the formal justice system have been overwhelmed by demand,
                                        highlighting the need for innovation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In cooperation with the Federal Government of Ethiopia, HiiL’s Justice
                                        Innovation Lab process led to the development of the Community Justice Center
                                        (CJC) model. Drawing on the success of customary courts in Oromia and the
                                        trusted role of shimagillé, the CJCs integrate traditional dispute resolution
                                        with formal mechanisms such as case referrals. This hybrid approach reduces
                                        pressure on courts while preserving cultural values and aligning with
                                        international human rights standards.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In 2025, CJCs have been launched in Addis Ababa, Afar, and Sidama regions,
                                        showing strong government support and potential for scale. Community justice
                                        models developed by the Justice Innovation Labs are also currently being piloted
                                        in Ogun State and Imo State in Nigeria. This work is transforming access to
                                        justice—bringing it closer to the people who need it most.

                                    <h4>Key learnings</h4>
                                    <p>A core learning from our work is that innovation in justice is not just about new
                                        tools or ideas : it’s about systems transformation. We learned that justice
                                        solutions must move from the fringes and form part of the key justice journeys
                                        people follow to resolve their justice problems. To truly deliver people-centred
                                        justice, we must create an enabling environment: incorporating innovations
                                        through legal and regulatory frameworks, policy planning, and budgets. For
                                        example, community-based services that link formal and informal systems can be
                                        highly effective—but only when their outcomes are recognised and supported by
                                        courts and institutions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We also caution against the "app-ification" of justice. While tech can improve
                                        access, it can also deepen inequalities. In Uganda, where internet access is
                                        limited, an online justice tool developed through our JIL had to be delivered
                                        through kiosks staffed by community workers. In Tunisia, stakeholders combined
                                        online and offline tools to deliver doorstep legal support through apprentice
                                        lawyers and paralegals.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These lessons apply across sectors: real innovation requires inclusive design,
                                        system integration, and context-sensitive delivery. Data, collaboration, and
                                        enabling environments must be the foundation of all innovation.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I look forward to hearing from attendees how they have managed to move solutions
                                        from design to implementation, and what they have learned on this journey. </p>

                                    <h4>About this work</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        L’Oréal’s HR Data Privacy team needed to communicate their Global Privacy Policy
                                        to employees worldwide. The original version,16 pages of legal language in Word
                                        format, was compliant but unreadable. The challenge: create clarity, foster
                                        engagement, and build trust across 90,000 employees, from factory to HQ.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        Legal Shake and Sagan Legal Design partnered to tackle this through legal
                                        design. We conducted deep research on L’Oréal’s internal culture, employee
                                        profiles, digital usage, and HR compliance goals. We mapped stakeholders, built
                                        personas and empathy maps, and explored the user journey to identify friction
                                        points.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        The key question driving our design brief: How might we show employees that
                                        taking control of their data helps them achieve their personal goals safely?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        The result: an interactive, digital tool, designed in Figma and implemented on
                                        L’Oréal’s SharePoint. Its tone, structure and interface made complex information
                                        actionable, accessible on any device, in any country.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We added playful games to boost engagement and ensure understanding of the
                                        policy.
                                        Following the global rollout, we were entrusted with adapting the format for
                                        France’s Local Privacy Policy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>


                                        Building on this success, we designed a Consents Portal, giving employees
                                        clarity and control over the use of their personal data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        What started as a static document became a dynamic legal ecosystem. The approach
                                        proved scalable, desirable, and replicable, redefining how legal content can be
                                        communicated and trusted within global organisations.

                                    </p>


                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The redesigned Global Privacy Policy was viewed by thousands of employees at
                                        launch, with immediate positive feedback. HR and legal teams saw a clear
                                        increase in understanding, interaction, and meaningful questions from employees
                                        about data use.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        This success led to the localisation of the tool for the French market, then to
                                        the development of the Consents Portal. That platform is now live and used
                                        daily, empowering employees to manage their own data choices in real time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        Each tool is a legal product but also a cultural signal. Employees see that
                                        privacy isn’t imposed; it’s co-designed with them in mind. Legal and HR teams
                                        saw the added value: more transparency, fewer misunderstandings, stronger
                                        engagement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        Together, these tools form a strategic ecosystem that aligns legal compliance
                                        with a respectful, empowering employee experience redefining how legal content

                                    <h4>Key learnings</h4>
                                    <p>This project proved that transforming legal understanding is not about
                                        simplifying law, but about designing for people. Legal design helped us bridge
                                        legal compliance and user engagement.
                                    </p>

                                        Key takeaways:
                                        <li> • Empathy is strategy: Researching users’ needs and fears is essential for
                                            relevance and trust.</li>
                                        <li>• Visual structure drives clarity: Layout, hierarchy, colour and navigation
                                            shape legal comprehension.</li>
                                        <li>• Iteration builds quality: Each test cycle refined the clarity, usability,
                                            and
                                            visual coherence of the tools.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Our methods are widely transferable to other companies, industries, and
                                        jurisdictions particularly where digital user experience meets legal complexity
                                        (e.g., consents, terms, onboarding, internal policies).
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Meet us at the conference</h4>
                                    <p>Right now, our main concern is: How might we integrate more fun and more beauty
                                        into legal experiences?
                                    </p>
                                    <p> We’d love to exchange ideas and stories about how you’ve brought fun and beauty
                                        into your own legal design work, what worked, what surprised you, what you’d try
                                        again.</p>

                                    <p> We’re also keen to explore replicability: How might we maintain clarity and
                                        compliance across languages, cultures, and regulations within large
                                        organisations? And how might we redesign consents, rights requests, or
                                        onboarding experiences as part of a better digital legal UX?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We’re looking forward to hearing what others are working on and building new
                                        collaborations!
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>About this work</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        My work is a strategic and service-oriented framework titled <strong>Regulatory
                                            Compliance as a Service (RCaaS)</strong>, designed to tackle the complex,
                                        fragmented, and often inaccessible nature of regulatory compliance across
                                        institutions, particularly in Kenya and Africa. Positioned at the intersection
                                        of governance, regulation, and digital transformation, RCaaS offers a modular,
                                        human-centred approach to rethinking legal systems within private and public
                                        sectors.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Rooted in my role as Head of Legal at a leading public health training
                                        institution, and inspired by years of public service, I developed RCaaS in
                                        response to recurring compliance bottlenecks, slow policy execution, opaque
                                        bureaucratic processes, and the growing demand for digitised governance. My work
                                        has been shaped by the urgent need to demystify regulation for public
                                        institutions, ensuring laws and policies don’t just exist, but actually work for
                                        people.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><strong>The RCaaS framework combines:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Regulatory Compliance Advisory – licensing, statutory obligations</li>
                                        <li>Risk &amp; Compliance Management Consulting – risk registers, policy
                                            alignment</li>
                                        <li>Legal Operations &amp; Contract Management – CLM systems, automation
                                            workflows</li>
                                        <li>Cybersecurity &amp; Data Protection Advisory – best practices, vendor
                                            selection</li>
                                        <li>Regulatory Change Monitoring – tracking legal reforms across Africa</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>
                                        The format is both a framework and a consultancy model, supported by technology
                                        and grounded in empathy. It offers structured yet adaptable solutions to help
                                        institutions modernize legal operations while improving transparency, and
                                        maintain regulatory readiness amid constant change.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The concept matured during my certification at MIT’s <em>LegalTech in the
                                            Digital Era</em> program, where I gained deeper insight into legal design,
                                        automation, and ethical tech use. RCaaS is ultimately a call to make law work
                                        better for people through intelligent, inclusive, and scalable design.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Impact</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The RCaaS framework has helped bridge the gap between regulatory intention and
                                        real-world implementation in complex institutional environments. By integrating
                                        digital tools into legal and compliance processes, my work has enabled public
                                        institutions to reduce delays, improve transparency, and build a culture of
                                        proactive governance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, in my current role, we digitised contract workflows, streamlined
                                        board governance using an eBoard system, and introduced compliance roadmaps that
                                        have reduced approval turnaround times by over 40%. This not only increased
                                        institutional efficiency but also improved stakeholder trust and accountability.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        More broadly, the framework has sparked dialogue about how legal operations and
                                        regulatory adherence can be reimagined, not through more bureaucracy, but
                                        through clarity, accessibility, and human-centred technology. RCaaS is now
                                        informing cross-sector discussions on how to simplify compliance in areas like
                                        healthcare, education, and licensing, particularly in resource-constrained
                                        environments.
                                    </p>

                                        The most meaningful impact has been shifting legal culture: from reactive
                                        enforcement to strategic enablement. Institutions are beginning to see
                                        compliance not as a burden, but as a service; one that, when designed well,
                                        empowers both institutions and the citizens they serve.
                                    </p>

                                        I am excited to connect with attendees and to exchange ideas on how legal
                                        systems can be redesigned to truly serve people, especially in complex,
                                        resource-limited environments. I look forward to sharing insights from my RCaaS
                                        framework, discussing the realities of digital transformation in African public
                                        institutions, and exploring how we can localise LegalTech without losing sight
                                        of empathy, equity, and context.

                                        I am also keen to learn how others are tackling regulatory complexity in their
                                        regions, how they’re integrating design thinking into compliance, and how we can
                                        move from static laws to living systems. Mostly, I am looking forward to
                                        conversations that are bold, practical, and human, whether we’re talking about
                                        CLM tools, policy reform, or that one time someone tried to run a big
                                        procurement on WhatsApp.

                                    <p>
                                        HUMAN OVERSAIGHT: THE OPS ROOM is a real-time generative, interactive
                                        audio-visual installation developed as a human oversight department for
                                        high-risk AI systems. It is established according to the European Artificial
                                        Intelligence Act [EU AI Act], as described in Article 14, which suggests that in
                                        high-risk AI systems a human-machine interface such as a “stop button” is
                                        needed, to bring the system to a halt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Can the system be stopped by a button, and why not? We investigate how can a
                                        human oversee and evaluate these processes, by visualising the internal
                                        operations of an automated system. We invite the visitors to take upon a central
                                        role in human oversight of high-risk AI systems and encourage them to engage
                                        with a human-machine interface to oversee the systems' operations. We provide
                                        possibilities for action for people to claim back their political agency to stop
                                        or affect the system.

                                        Participants are able to use a physical interface*, to navigate and control the
                                        visual input on the LED wall. The imagery shown on the wall is a mix of
                                        real-time surveillance input, including a face detection software, as well as
                                        synthetic imagery created via custom-made machine learning-based models.

                                        While interacting, and navigating this content, the participants are directly
                                        affecting the algorithm, changing the content on the screen in real-time. Each
                                        activity is logged, irreversibly changing the system and its content. In such
                                        interactive feedback loop, we explore how quickly human input can affect a
                                        seemingly organised system, and change its rules. Besides the real-time visual
                                        output, we present the logs, which are anonymously stored.

                                        Moreover, this installation presents the first human-computer interface for AI
                                        oversight and stop-button available to the public, as a tool for oversight,
                                        simulation, and agency.

                                    <p>
                                        The guiding question of the project is: How can people and communities regain
                                        their political power by engaging in human-oversight of Artificial Intelligence
                                        (AI) systems?
                                        More concrete: the EU AI Act proposes new concepts that leave many questions
                                        open to be answered—for example related to the human oversight of high-risk AI
                                        systems. Instead of leaving these questions to the experts, lawyers, engineers,
                                        programmers and designers, we believe people should give meaning to these
                                        abstract concepts by immediate experience and real-time interaction. The project
                                        offers embodied and situated ways for social participation in the definition of
                                        the AI legalities—what is legal-illegal, lawful-unlawful, right or wrong.
                                        In the HUMAN OVERSIGHT installation through an immersive, physical and embodied
                                        experience participants have the opportunity to engage with the first
                                        human-oversight interface designed for public participation, while constructing
                                        a meaningful socio-political understanding of EU AI regulation and the role they
                                        play in defining how they are affected by AI in their daily lives.

                                        tangible, and closer to people. By making legal concepts and imaginaries
                                        tangible, people can interact and embody new roles that provides awareness and
                                        confidence to regain their political power about the limits and possibilities of
                                        AI—people have something to say and do about it, they just need the spaces to do
                                        so!

                                        Making such processes and tasks experienceable to a general audience –people
                                        likely without any professional knowledge in technical or legal field– can
                                        expose a critical insight into specific and concrete challenges of navigating
                                        the role in the automated decision-making processes under human oversight, while
                                        enhancing social awareness and technical demands that are intersecting at the
                                        developed scenario in the EU AI Act being taken into action.
